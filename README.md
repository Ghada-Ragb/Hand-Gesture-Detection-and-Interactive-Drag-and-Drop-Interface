# Hand-Gesture-Detection-and-Interactive-Drag-and-Drop-Interface
Hand Gesture Detection and Interactive Drag-and-Drop Interface (Computer Vision).

This Python code implements a hand gesture detection system using the MediaPipe library and OpenCV, allowing users to interact with digital objects through hand movements. The handDetector class processes video input to identify hand landmarks and calculate distances between fingers. It allows for real-time detection and displays the number of fingers raised. Additionally, a drag-and-drop rectangle interface is created, where rectangles can be moved based on hand gestures, specifically when a certain distance between fingers is detected. The rectangles are rendered on the video feed, providing an engaging way for users to interact with the interface using hand motions. The program continuously captures video frames while updating the displayed content based on detected gestures.
